lipstick-launchermonitor
========================

I wanted to examine and possibly manipulate Sailfish launcher app shortcuts, so it made sense to use the ready code, but I don't need the whole Lipstick. So this is a minimal extraction from the Lipstick project slightly modified for compiling on Qt 5.1.

A mininal extraction from Jolla Sailfish (and NemoMobile project) app launcher monitor. Original is at https://github.com/nemomobile/lipstick/
